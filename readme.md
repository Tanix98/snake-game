### Potential future features
- Grey walls with randomized sizes and spawn locations scattered throughout the map. Will result in game over if snake hits them
- ~~Different colored snake head~~
- ~~Improved accessibility with aria label, role and colorblind friendly color palette~~
- Snake able to turn backwards if no apples have been eaten
- Sound effects
- Background image
- Game Over alert replaced with text on canvas element

### Known issues:
- Snake body will often increase by two instead of one when eating the first apple, and a green block will show up for 1 second nearby
- Snake cannot collide with the last part of its body
- Grey wall only spawns as one block
- Low chance of snake spawning inside wall
